Hi there! Iâ€™m Wilson, a software developer with side quests on cooking, coffee, and bicycles in San Francisco Bay Area.

These days, I mostly write Go, some CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript when necessary. I also write Ruby occasionally, as a treat. I like to talk about Linux, containers, declarative infrastructure, and the human components of a system.

This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). Styling was composed with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), though I allow myself to break the convention quite generously. Colorscheme is based on [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox). Wrote the whole site by myself without any pre-built styling components!
