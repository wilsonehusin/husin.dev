Hi, I'm Wilson, a software developer in San Francisco, California. I really like to **make things go fast ⚡️**

{{< callout class="info" >}}
I'm looking for my next role! Proficient in **Go** and **Ruby**, as well as general **web and cloud infrastructure**. Schedule a chat with me at [cal.com/husin](https://cal.com/husin).
{{< /callout >}}

My most gratifying accomplishments are when I deliver my work to products and organizations which users would pleasantly notice over time despite minimal publicity.

In an organization of ~100 engineers, I cut their CI system's p95 execution time from over 25 minutes to under 10 minutes, with average down from 12 minutes to 6 minutes.

{{< callout class="testimonial" >}}
"**CI is so good** now that letting it run has **fast** enough feedback loop compared to locally running tests."
{{< /callout >}}

In the same period, I tamed test stability from ~70% to 99%.

{{< callout class="testimonial" >}}
"I used to hit retry on CI **at least once a day** and I have **not done it in the last month**."
{{< /callout >}}

## Technical details

Generally, I feel at home with Ruby and Go projects, from system programming to web applications. I have worked with several Rails code bases and spent a few years working on Kubernetes and the cloud-native ecosystem.

I have contributed features and bug fixes for front-end applications in various JavaScript and TypeScript code bases, but I'm more comfortable with CSS than any frameworks.

I made this site without pre-built components!

All in all, I have reasonable skillset to be comfortable throughout different layers of software, more productive in some than others.

## How I work

My problem-solving work usually starts with the following:

- Where is the pain point? Example: all the data is there, but making sense out of it is hard.
- What does solving this enable us? Example: eliminates 90% of error noise, therefore only reporting errors which we want to know about.

These items help me identify the people who would benefit from my work and allow me to effectively collaborate with them, bringing solutions that solves real problems.

If software is a garden, I like to enable other gardeners to focus on their plants special needs while I make sure the general needs (water, fertilizers, etc) becomes the least of concern when building a thriving ecosystem as a team.

## What I'm looking for

I would like to work on difficult problems with kind people. I perform best when an organization encourages collective ownership of development and roadmap.
As such, it is personally important for me to work with folks interested to discuss and learn from the problems, then engineer the solution appropriately. Software is a team sport!

## Good match?

Companies which may benefit the most from my work:

- Working on reliability and confidence in running software.
- Looking to smooth out internal engineering workflow.
- Finding for reasons why something takes too long.
- Wants assurance that every dollar spent on cloud is worth the cost.
