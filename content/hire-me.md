Hi, I'm Wilson, [a software developer at FireHydrant](/firehydrant-year-1/) based in San Francisco, California. I really like to **make things go fast ⚡️**

{{< callout class="briefcase" >}}
Existence of this page does not imply job search status. It is left up for reference on what it's like to work with me!
{{</ callout >}}

My focus is on building developer experience and reliable infrastructure. You may find my work to be incredibly useful if you are looking to:

- Speed up systems, whether software or processes.
- Increase reliability of services.
- Build durability throughout integration layers.
- Create self-serve infrastructure-as-code for product development teams.
- Optimize costs of cloud computing and development tools.

Various skills that I would be bringing to your organization:

- Proficient in Go and Ruby, decent with JavaScript and CSS, comfortable with anything that needs to be done.
- Experience of managing Kubernetes clusters, container runtimes, and various Linux quirks in production.
- Periodically packing bite-size lessons on observability and operations.
- Collaborating closely with users and customers.
- Managing projects from inception to production.

Ultimately, I would like to work on difficult problems with kind people. If it sounds like we could be a good fit, I would like to hear from you!

Some snippets of kind words from past colleagues about me:

{{< callout class="testimonial" >}}
"When you approve my PRs, something about that makes me feel like the code is actually good and safe."
{{</ callout >}}

{{< callout class="testimonial" >}}
"**CI is so good** now that letting it run has **fast** enough feedback loop compared to locally running tests."
{{</ callout >}}

{{< callout class="testimonial" >}}
"I used to hit retry on CI **at least once a day** and I have **not done it in the last month**."
{{</ callout >}}

My most gratifying accomplishments are when I deliver my work to products and organizations which users would pleasantly notice over time despite minimal publicity.

- At Modern Treasury, I worked in internal tools and build system.

  - I cut down their continuous integration (CI) execution time from p95 of over 25 minutes to under 10 minutes, with the average down from 14 minutes to 6 minutes.
  - During the same time, I stabilized their test stability from ~70% to 99%.
  - **This 1.5 month work resulting in over 60 engineering hours saved per week**, allowing ~100 engineers to maintain their focus on development.

- I spent about 4 years at Pivotal and VMware working on Kubernetes.

  - I was part of the release engineering team for open-source Kubernetes project, shepherding releases between 1.19 and 1.22 cycles.
  - Internally, I was mostly involved in release engineering where I **eliminated false positive CVE alerts, which accounts for 90% of alerts**, and led development towards **50% faster artifact builds, saving over 100 engineering hours per week**.

- I was a software engineer at Maca where I drove implementation of the company's first product from its inception.

  - I worked on getting the system to be SOC 2 compliant.
  - Built out interview rubric.
  - Got my hands on all corners of the engineering department.

- I was at Cerner Corporation, which was acquired by Oracle recently, for a year.
  - I built out integrations across services to comply with GDPR right to erasure throughout 10+ year old legacy systems.
  - I also flushed out the release system to be faster (from 2 hours to 40 minutes).
