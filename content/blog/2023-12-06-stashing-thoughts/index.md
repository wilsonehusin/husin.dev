  Started incorporating note-taking system to my workflow for about a week and I‚Äôm surprised how helpful it has been.

Sometimes, I feel like life and creative work is similar to open world games: a lot of side quests may show up when you least expect them.

I have been doing a lot of exploratory projects lately around NixOS and homelab. In that development flow, my ‚Äúenterprise software developer‚Äù brain often finds forks on the thought path.

I _used_ to be able to leave such thoughts in my head and come back later, picking up where I left off. That has not been the case in the recent years. Usually it would turn into:

- Distracted from the main path of work
- Forgotten and realizing it was left behind after too long
- Half-assing the main path because I worry that I might forget that sidetrack.

The last two somewhat points to: _if it‚Äôs important, it will come back_. Sure, but it will come back with incomplete picture and usually it implies an unactionable state.

The generic solution and response is ‚Äúnote it down‚Äù. I was never a big notetaker, despite the many attempts to ‚Äúget into the habit‚Äù.

Surprisingly, the resistance to note-taking workflow appeared to have changed in the last week. I still don‚Äôt definitively know why, especially since I don't think there is anything distinct about [the new note taking application](/bear) I have compared to, say, regular Apple notes. Certainly too soon to tell if the habit stays, but it has been significant enough to feel the improvement.

Upon I encountering a fork of thought flow, I started stashing them in my notes. At the end of my focus session, I would revisit and add any additional information that I didn‚Äôt capture first time around.

I have Bear notes always on in the background so getting to it requires so little activation energy ‚Äî takes about 1-2 seconds with muscle memory for the hotkeys.

1. Open application switcher (`Cmd ‚åò` + `Tab ‚Üπ`)
1. Select Bear
1. Regardless of current state of application, create new note (`Cmd ‚åò`)
1. Hide everything except for editor (`Ctrl ^` + `1`)
1. Write out just enough to revisit later
1. Go back to whatever I was doing before that intrusive thought kicked in

Now I have dozens of half-baked idea, waiting to be revisited. Future me will find out, and possibly report back, on how useful they are.
