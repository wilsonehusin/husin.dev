  How to build a container while using Nix without using Nix. Expect sharp edges around.
---

While there are blessed paths to build containers with Nix tooling, Nix comes with store paths which we can take advantage of in building containers. For the record, I never claim this to be a good idea.

## Crash course on Nix purity

If you're already familiar with Nix, feel free to skip this section and jump to [_containers_ section](#with-containers)

{{</ callout >}}

Nix purists like to describe Nix's trait as "pure". I did not find this explanation helpful, until I realized and combined this with another piece of the puzzle: _Linux works through convention_. Despite many variations of Linux distributions, most would see `/usr/local/bin` in their `$PATH` by default. People expect `/bin/bash` to exist and dynamically linked libc is under `/usr/lib`.

Conventions are great during setup because it speeds up the process. However, expecting convention to be retained over long-lived instances would be naÃ¯ve, just like the statements from people buying white sneakers.

Instead of following conventions to internals, Nix built its store through a read-only (for users) directory under `/nix/store`. In the following example, I told Nix to install curl such that it will be available system-wide and not just single user.

```nix
# configuration.nix

# List packages installed in system profile.
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [ curl ];
```

```shell-session
$ # Verify that curl is installed
$ curl --version
curl 8.4.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/8.4.0 OpenSSL/3.0.11 zlib/1.3
  brotli/1.1.0 zstd/1.5.5 libidn2/2.3.4 libssh2/1.11.0 nghttp2/1.57.0

$ # Where is it installed?
$ which curl
/run/current-system/sw/bin/curl

$ # But I was promised it would be in /nix/store!?
$ file `which curl`
/run/current-system/sw/bin/curl: symbolic link to
  /nix/store/0g1lq3vff290wainxdlbz9a18m28pr4r-curl-8.4.0-bin/bin/curl
```

Now, curl is a dynamically linked binary to various libraries. Let's look at how we can find those libraries.

```shell-session
$ # Most Linux distributions would expect this to have something.
$ ls /lib /usr/lib
ls: cannot access '/lib': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access '/usr/lib': No such file or directory

$ # However, Nix also have them in /nix/store :)
$ readlink `which curl` | xargs file
/nix/store/0g1lq3vff290wainxdlbz9a18m28pr4r-curl-8.4.0-bin/bin/curl:

    ...
```

By patching these import paths, Nix can ensure that programs can remain _pure_. If I happen to install a different program requiring a different version of the same libraries, Nix will store them separately and individual programs will know which designated version to import.
